Overview
This page provides a quick-start guide for setting up a minimal development environment and building the master branch of Chromium/CEF for development purposes. For a comprehensive discussion of the available tools and configurations visit the BranchesAndBuilding Wiki page.

This guide is NOT intended for:

Those seeking a prebuilt binary distribution for use in third-party apps. Go here instead.
Those seeking to build the binary distribution in a completely automated manner. Go here instead.
Development systems can be configured using dedicated hardware or a VMware, Parallels or VirtualBox virtual machine.

The below steps can often be used to develop the most recent release branch of CEF/Chromium in addition to the master branch. Chromium build requirements change over time so review the build requirements listed on the BranchesAndBuilding Wiki page before attempting to build a release branch. Then just add --branch=XXXX to the automate-git.py command-line where "XXXX" is the branch number you wish to build.

File Structure
The same file structure will be used on all platforms. "~" can be any path that does not include spaces or special characters. We'll be building this directory structure for each platform in the following sections.

~/code/
  automate/
    automate-git.py   <-- CEF build script
  chromium_git/
    cef/              <-- CEF source checkout
    chromium/
      src/            <-- Chromium source checkout
    update.[bat|sh]   <-- Bootstrap script for automate-git.py
  depot_tools/        <-- Chromium build tools
With this file structure you can develop multiple CEF/Chromium branches side-by-side. For example, repeat the below instructions using "chromium_git1" as the directory name instead of "chromium_git".

Windows Setup
What's Required

Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit OS.
Visual Studio VS2017 15.7.1+ installed in the default location.
Windows 10.0.17763 SDK installed in the default location. You must install this exact SDK version to avoid build issues.
At least 8GB of RAM and 40GB of free disk space.
Approximately 2 hours with a fast internet connection (25Mbps) and fast build machine (2.6Ghz+, 4+ logical cores).
Step-by-step Guide

All of the below commands should be run using the system "cmd.exe" and not a Cygwin shell.

1. Create the following directories.

c:\code\automate
c:\code\chromium_git
WARNING: If you change the above directory names/locations make sure to (a) use only ASCII characters and (b) choose a short file path (less than 35 characters total). Otherwise, some tooling may fail later in the build process due to invalid or overly long file paths.

2. Download depot_tools.zip and extract to "c:\code\depot_tools". Do not use drag-n-drop or copy-n-paste extract from Explorer, this will not extract the hidden ".git" folder which is necessary for depot_tools to auto-update itself. You can use "Extract all..." from the context menu though. 7-zip is also a good tool for this.

3. Run "update_depot_tools.bat" to install Python, Git and SVN.

cd c:\code\depot_tools
update_depot_tools.bat
4. Add the "c:\code\depot_tools" folder to your system PATH. For example, on Windows 10:

Run the "SystemPropertiesAdvanced" command.
Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
Double-click on "Path" under "System variables" to edit the value.
5. Download the automate-git.py script to "c:\code\automate\automate-git.py".

6. Create the "c:\code\chromium_git\update.bat" script with the following contents.

set GN_DEFINES=use_jumbo_build=true is_component_build=true
set GN_ARGUMENTS=--ide=vs2017 --sln=cef --filters=//cef/*
python ..\automate\automate-git.py --download-dir=c:\code\chromium_git --depot-tools-dir=c:\code\depot_tools --no-distrib --no-build
Run the "update.bat" script and wait for CEF and Chromium source code to download. CEF source code will be downloaded to "c:\code\chromium_git\cef" and Chromium source code will be downloaded to "c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src". After download completion the CEF source code will be copied to "c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src\cef".

cd c:\code\chromium_git
update.bat
7. Create the "c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src\cef\create.bat" script with the following contents.

set GN_DEFINES=use_jumbo_build=true is_component_build=true
set GN_ARGUMENTS=--ide=vs2017 --sln=cef --filters=//cef/*
call cef_create_projects.bat
Run the "create.bat" script to generate Ninja and Visual Studio project files.

cd c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src\cef
create.bat
This will generate a "c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src\out\Debug_GN_x86\cef.sln" file that can be loaded in Visual Studio for debugging and compiling individual files. Replace “x86” with “x64” in this path to work with the 64-bit build instead of the 32-bit build. Always use Ninja to build the complete project. Repeat this step if you change the project configuration or add/remove files in the GN configuration (BUILD.gn file).

8. Create a Debug build of CEF/Chromium using Ninja. Replace “x86” with “x64” in the below example to generate a 64-bit build instead of a 32-bit build. Edit the CEF source code at "c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src\cef" and repeat this step multiple times to perform incremental builds while developing.

cd c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src
ninja -C out\Debug_GN_x86 cef
9. Run the resulting cefclient sample application.

cd c:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src
out\Debug_GN_x86\cefclient.exe
See the Windows debugging guide for detailed debugging instructions.

以上为官网给出的编译步骤，但还是需要注意一下几点。
1.在执行update.bat之前需要设置的环境变量CEF_USE_GN=1，DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0，DEPOT_TOOLS(可能需要)
2.设置winows sdk版本，原始配置可能与安装的版本不一致。替换chromium\src\cef\patch\patches\gn_config.patch
3.update.bat的目录为 C:\code\chromium_git
4.create.bat的目录为 C:\code\chromium_git\chromium\src\cef
5.执行编译命令 ninja -C out\Debu_GN_x64 cef
6.编译64位会出现错误,需要将out\Debu_GN_x64 文件夹下的dbhelp.dll删除,否则出现exe执行出错,退出编译过程
